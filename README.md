# Tobacco Consumption Causes & Effects
The Project proposes to create a database of tobacco consumption-related data and to obtain meaningful correlations between its causes and effects, of which will be filtered and visualized accordingly. Selection of different datasets is conducted to find relevant attributes, which are all ordered by location and time entries. In further steps of the project, countries and their given data will be filtered by commonly shared periods to provide consistent analysis. Although it is yet to be decided, these findings and interpretations will be presented on a user-friendly website to showcase the end-user experience of a Database System.
